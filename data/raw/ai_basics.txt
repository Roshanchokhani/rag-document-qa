Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

Machine Learning Basics
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. It has achieved breakthrough results in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing
NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key tasks include sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and question answering.

Computer Vision
Computer vision allows machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. Applications include image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition systems.
